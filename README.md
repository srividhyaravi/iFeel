# iFeel
iFeel uses NLP Technology to extract semantic meta-data from tweets. From this we are able to determine whether or not the sentiment of a particular user's social page is uncommonly negative. Built using Javascript, chart.js and Flask. IBM Watson Tone Analyser is used for extracting sentiments

# FUTURE WORK
1. Extracting sentiments from pictures. (Our implementation only extracts sentiments from text at the moment)
